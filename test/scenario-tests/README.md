![](../../assets/scenario-tests.png)

This project directory will demonstrate how you may chain multiple API requests to perform scenario based testing in vREST NG Application.

We have created this sample project using which you can easily get started with scenario based Testing, just by importing this as a Project in your vREST NG Workspace area.

Let us see how you can do that,

## Step 1 - Download & Install vREST NG
* First of all, you need to have vREST NG Application installed on your system.
* Download it from our [website](https://ng.vrest.io) (for your OS).
